Description: A regularized projection score method is proposed for estimating treatment effects in quantile regression in the presence of high-dimensional confounding covariates. This method is based on an estimated projection score function of the low-dimensional treatment parameters in the presence of high-dimensional confounding covariates. We propose one-step algorithm and a reffitted wild bootstrapping approach for variance estimation. This enables us to construct confidence intervals for the treatment effects in the high-dimensional circumstances.
